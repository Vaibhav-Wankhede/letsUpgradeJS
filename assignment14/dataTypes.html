            Brief Information about Data Types in JavaScript
        </h1><br>
        <h2> string</h2>
        <p>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes<br>
            var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";<br>
            var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";</p>
        <br>
        <h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>
        <p>JavaScript has only one type of numbers.Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
            <br>
            var x1 = 34.00; <br>
            var x2 = 34; 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>JavaScript Booleans</h2>
        <p>Booleans can only have two values: true or false.<br>
            var x = 5;<br>
            var y = 5;<br>
            var z = 6;<br>
            (x == y)       // Returns true <br>
            (x == z)       // Returns false</p>
        <br>
        <h2>JavaScript Arrays</h2>
        <p>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

            Array items are separated by commas.
            
            The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):</p>
         <p>var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</p>  
         <br>
         <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2> 
        <p>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

            Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</p>
        <p>var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};</p>
